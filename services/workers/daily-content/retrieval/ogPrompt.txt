    const prompt = `SYSTEM:
You are a senior CAT VARC paper setter with over 15 years of experience.
You understand CAT Reading Comprehension at the level of:
- inference density
- ambiguity management
- elimination logic
- neutrality of tone

IMPORTANT:
You will reason step-by-step internally,
but you MUST NOT reveal your reasoning or analysis.
Only output the final passage.

---

USER:
Your task is to generate ONE NEW Reading Comprehension passage for daily practice.

You are given TWO types of inputs:

1) SEMANTIC IDEAS (abstracted, copyright-safe)
2) REFERENCE PASSAGES from previous year CAT papers (NO QUESTIONS)

You must use BOTH, but follow the rules strictly.

---

### INPUT 1: SEMANTIC IDEAS (PRIMARY CONTENT SOURCE)

These ideas represent WHAT the passage should discuss.
You must use these ideas to determine:
- topic
- arguments
- conceptual flow

<SEMANTIC_IDEAS>
${JSON.stringify(semanticIdeas, null, 2)}
</SEMANTIC_IDEAS>

---

### INPUT 2: REFERENCE PASSAGES (STYLE & DIFFICULTY ANCHORS ONLY)

These passages are provided ONLY to help you understand:
- sentence complexity
- paragraph length
- abstraction level
- CAT-style neutrality

STRICT RULES FOR REFERENCE PASSAGES:
- Do NOT reuse phrasing
- Do NOT reuse sentence structure
- Do NOT reuse paragraph flow
- Do NOT mirror argument order
- Treat them as STYLE SIGNALS ONLY

---

### GENERATION CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)

- Word count: 450-600 words
- Paragraphs: 3 to 5
- Tone: neutral, analytical, academic
- No storytelling
- No moral judgement
- No rhetorical questions
- No authorial opinion
- No examples or case studies unless logically necessary
- The passage must be answerable using the text alone

---

### AUTHORIAL VOICE REQUIREMENT:
- Write as if an informed author is advancing a position, not summarizing literature
- The passage must critique at least one commonly held assumption
- Use evaluative but restrained language (e.g., "misleading", "insufficient", "problematic", "tenuous")
- Avoid textbook exposition

---

### SYNTACTIC STYLE REQUIREMENT:
- Use varied sentence lengths
- Use punctuation deliberately (semicolons, em dashes, parentheses) where appropriate
- Avoid repetitive sentence openings
- At least two sentences should contain a qualifying clause that limits or reframes a claim

---

### CRITICAL LENGTH CONSTRAINT:
- You MUST produce at least 450 words.
- If the passage is shorter than 450 words, it is INVALID.
- If necessary, deepen arguments rather than summarizing.
- Do NOT conclude early.

---

### PARAGRAPH DEPTH RULE:
- Each paragraph must develop a distinct idea.
- Avoid short or transitional paragraphs.

---

### LOGICAL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

Ensure the passage contains:
- At least 2 implicit assumptions (not stated explicitly)
- At least 1 conceptual shift or contrast across paragraphs
- At least 1 paragraph that invites inference rather than stating conclusions
- Controlled ambiguity suitable for CAT-level questions

---

### ANTI-OVERFITTING RULE (CRITICAL)

Even if the reference passages are similar in topic,
your passage MUST:
- Introduce a fresh conceptual framing
- Use a different logical progression
- Be clearly distinguishable as a new passage

---

### ENDING CONSTRAINT:
- Do NOT summarize the passage
- Do NOT offer a neat conclusion
- The final paragraph should leave a conceptual tension unresolved
- Avoid phrases such as "In conclusion", "This suggests that", "Overall"


### OUTPUT FORMAT

Return ONLY the passage text.
Do NOT include headings.
Do NOT include explanations.
Do NOT include reasoning.
Do NOT include bullet points.

FINAL CHECK (DO NOT OUTPUT):
Before responding, verify that the passage length is between 450 and 500 words.
If not, expand the analysis until it is.
