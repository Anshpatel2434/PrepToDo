		},
		jumbled_sentences: { 1: "", 2: "", 3: "", 4: "" },
		correct_answer: { answer: "B" },
		rationale:
			"The correct answer is B. The author suggests that anti-globalisation movements often misinterpret the nature of cultural exchange. This is evident in the passage where the author discusses how these movements invoke a nostalgic yearning for an imagined past, overlooking the historical reality that cultural exchange has always been a vital aspect of human history. The author emphasizes that the fear of globalisation eroding local cultures is based on an untenable assumption that cultural identities can exist in isolation.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option A is eliminated because, while the author acknowledges that anti-globalisation sentiments arise from legitimate concerns, they do not endorse these movements as justified. The passage critiques the nostalgia for a preserved cultural integrity, indicating that the author does not fully support the movements' stance. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option C can be dismissed as it inaccurately suggests that the author views anti-globalisation movements as a recent phenomenon. The passage discusses the historical roots of cultural exchange and implies that such movements are not new, but rather part of a long-standing discourse surrounding cultural identity.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option D is also incorrect as the author does not argue that anti-globalisation movements are essential for maintaining cultural integrity. Instead, the passage highlights the complexities of cultural exchange and suggests that the movements may inadvertently perpetuate exclusionary practices, rather than being essential to cultural integrity.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Thus, the only option that accurately reflects the author's perspective is B.",

			"What is the tone of the author when discussing the concept of 'pure' culture?",
		question_type: "rc_question",
		options: {
			A: "Skeptical and critical of the notion.",
			B: "Nostalgic and longing for the past.",

		},
		jumbled_sentences: { 1: "", 2: "", 3: "", 4: "" },
		correct_answer: { answer: "A" },
		rationale:
			"The correct answer is A) Skeptical and critical of the notion. The passage explicitly states that the idea of a “pure” culture is an illusion, indicating a clear skepticism towards the concept. The author argues that this notion fails to account for the historical intermingling of cultures, which challenges the idea of static cultural identities. This critical perspective is reinforced throughout the passage, as the author emphasizes the complexities of identity formation in a globalized world.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option B) Nostalgic and longing for the past is tempting because it suggests a yearning for a time when cultural integrity was supposedly preserved. However, the passage critiques this nostalgia by highlighting that cultural exchange has always been a vital aspect of human history. The author does not express a longing for the past but rather critiques the misconceptions surrounding it, thus eliminating this option.\n" +
			"\n" +
			'Option C) Neutral and objective in analysis is misleading. While the author presents a nuanced discussion, the tone is decidedly critical of simplistic views on culture. The use of terms like "egregiously overlooks" and "woefully insufficient" indicates a strong stance against the oversimplification of cultural identities, which contradicts the notion of neutrality.\n' +
			"\n" +
			"Option D) Supportive and affirming of cultural authenticity is also incorrect. The passage argues against the idea of a “pure” culture, which undermines any support for cultural authenticity as a static concept. The author’s emphasis on the dynamic nature of cultural identities directly opposes the idea of affirming a singular notion of authenticity.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Thus, the only option that accurately reflects the author's tone regarding the concept of 'pure' culture is A.",

			A: "Cultural exchange has historically been a minor aspect of human interactions.",

		},
		jumbled_sentences: { 1: "", 2: "", 3: "", 4: "" },
		correct_answer: { answer: "C" },
		rationale:
			"The correct answer is C) Cultural exchange has always been a vital aspect of human history. The passage emphasizes that cultural exchange is not a recent phenomenon but a fundamental aspect of human interactions throughout history. It argues against the notion that cultural identities can exist in isolation and highlights the importance of mobility and adaptation in cultural evolution.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option A) Cultural exchange has historically been a minor aspect of human interactions is tempting because it suggests a lesser role for cultural exchange. However, this contradicts the passage's assertion that cultural exchange has been essential for human survival and cultural evolution, as stated in the line discussing how societies have thrived through adaptation and integration.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option D) Cultural exchange is a recent phenomenon driven by technological advancements misrepresents the passage's argument. While technology has accelerated cultural exchange, the passage clearly states that cultural exchange has deep historical roots, thus invalidating the idea that it is a recent development.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option B) Cultural exchange is often viewed as a threat to local cultures is partially accurate but does not capture the passage's broader argument. While the passage discusses anti-globalisation movements and their concerns, it ultimately frames cultural exchange as a vital and historical process rather than merely a threat, making it less comprehensive than option C.",

		jumbled_sentences: { 1: "", 2: "", 3: "", 4: "" },
		correct_answer: { answer: "C" },
		rationale:
			'The correct answer is C) Cultural identities are dynamic and shaped by historical processes of exchange. The passage emphasizes that cultural identities are not static but are instead dynamic constructs formed through centuries of interaction and exchange. This perspective challenges the notion of "pure" cultures and highlights the historical roots of globalization, indicating that cultural identities evolve through continuous cultural mixing.\n' +
			"\n" +
			"Option A) Globalisation leads to the erosion of all cultural identities is tempting because it reflects a common concern regarding globalization. However, the passage argues that cultural identities thrive through adaptation and integration rather than being entirely eroded. This is evident in the statement that cultural exchange has always been a vital aspect of human history, which contradicts the idea of complete erosion.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option B) Cultural identities are static and unaffected by globalisation misrepresents the author's argument. The passage explicitly states that cultural identities are dynamic and shaped by historical processes, directly opposing the notion of static identities. The author critiques the view of cultures as monolithic, reinforcing the idea that they are influenced by ongoing exchanges.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Option D) Globalisation is solely responsible for cultural homogenisation is misleading. While the passage discusses concerns about homogenization, it clarifies that the critique should not be directed solely at globalization but rather at the failure to recognize historical processes that have always facilitated cultural exchange. This nuanced view is essential to understanding the complexities of cultural identity in a globalized context.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Thus, options A, B, and D are effectively dismissed based on the passage's arguments, leaving C as the only accurate representation of the author's perspective.",
