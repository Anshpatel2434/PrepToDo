# PrepToDo: The Intelligent CAT VARC Core

PrepToDo is more than just a question bank; it's a personalized performance engine built specifically for the **CAT VARC** (Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension) section. 

## The Core Offering: What the User Sees

When a user lands on PrepToDo, they are greeted with a high-end, data-driven experience designed to eliminate the "guesswork" from CAT preparation.

### 1. The Daily Challenge
- **Freshness Every Day**: A bespoke Reading Comprehension (RC) or Verbal Ability (VA) set generated every 24 hours. 
- **Current & Relevant**: Passages are sourced from real-world articles (Philosophy, Science, Economics, etc.), ensuring the user never runs out of high-quality, relevant practice.
- **CAT-Aligned Difficulty**: Every question is modeled after actual Previous Year Questions (PYQs) to match the exam's exact logic and trap styles.

### 2. The AI-Powered Dashboard
Once the user starts practicing, their dashboard becomes a "Control Center" for improvement:
- **Skill Radar**: A visual map showing where they excel (e.g., Inference, Data-based questions) and where they need focus.
- **Genre Heatmap**: Identifies if they struggle with specific topics—maybe they're great at "Technology" articles but struggle with "Abstract Philosophy."
- **Logic Gap Detection**: Pinpoints exactly where their reasoning fails. It’s not just about "wrong answers"; it's about identifying the *type* of logical error.

### 3. Customized Mock Sets
- Users can generate personalized mock tests on-demand, tailored to their weak areas or specific interests, allowing for hyper-focused training sessions.

## How the User Improves: The "Aha!" Moment

The true power of PrepToDo lies in **how** it teaches users to think.

- **Reasoning Graph Rationales**: Most platforms tell you *what* the right answer is. PrepToDo shows you *why* through a logical path. It maps out the "elimination route," showing how each option is either supported or debunked by the text.
- **Elimination Strategy**: By focusing on why wrong options are traps, users naturally develop the "CAT mindset"—the ability to see through misleading choices.
- **Consistency through Gamification**: Daily streaks and leaderboards turn the grueling VARC prep into a daily habit.
