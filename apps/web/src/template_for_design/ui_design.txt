These are the UI preferences that I have researched for the project purpose : 
Academic Exam Prep Interface – UI Guidelines
Light Theme Palette

Use a gentle, off-white base to reduce glare. For example, a background like #F7FAFC (off-white) or very light gray is easy on the eyes
blog.designcrowd.com
. Pair it with a dark slate gray text (e.g. #1E293B or #2D3748) rather than pure black – dark gray on off-white “looks better and still passes accessibility rules”
inclusiveweb.co
. Accent colors can be soft pastels or muted tones: for instance, a calm blue (#2563EB) for primary buttons/links and a mild green (#68D391) for secondary highlights. These maintain a clear hierarchy without harsh contrast. Pastel backgrounds are known to “notably reduce eye strain, especially when paired with darker text”
blog.designcrowd.com
, making them ideal for long reading sessions. Ensure all text-to-background contrasts meet WCAG (4.5:1), e.g. #2563EB on #F7FAFC (≈5:1 contrast) for interactive elements.

Dark Theme Palette

For low-light use, employ a gray-based dark mode. Use a rich dark gray as the base (e.g. #0F172A or #1E293B) instead of pure black
altersquare.medium.com
. On this background, use light gray text (e.g. #E2E8F0 for primary text, #94A3B8 for secondary text) to achieve comfortable contrast without glare. This “negative polarity” dark mode should still meet accessibility (e.g. #E2E8F0 on #0F172A ≈ 7:1 contrast). A recommendation is “Use dark grays instead of pure black backgrounds to reduce eye strain and improve readability”
altersquare.medium.com
. Accent colors (e.g. medium-blue #60A5FA or teal #2DD4BF) should be desaturated to pass contrast easily and avoid harsh highlights. In sum, dark-mode colors are the inverse of light-mode tokens, but all chosen grays and muted accents reduce fatigue in dim environments.

Typography and Fonts

Choose clean, highly legible fonts. For body text, use a neutral sans-serif (e.g. Inter, Helvetica, Arial) – these “are clean, simple, and work well for most interfaces”
inclusiveweb.co
. For headings or emphasis, introduce a complementary serif (e.g. Merriweather, Georgia, or Libre Baskerville). Serif fonts are associated with tradition and trust
designmodo.com
 and can “grab readers’ attention” in headings
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, while sans-serifs ensure clarity on screens
designmodo.com
inclusiveweb.co
. A typical pairing is one serif (for titles/quotes) and one sans (for paragraphs and UI labels).

Font Sizes: Use at least 16px for body text (1rem), which is the minimum for comfortable reading on screens
inclusiveweb.co
. For exam prep (content-heavy), consider 18–20px. Headings scale up (for example, ~2rem for H1, 1.5rem for H2, etc.) to create a clear hierarchy. Buttons and labels should also use ≥16px text for legibility
inclusiveweb.co
.

Line Spacing: Apply generous line-height (around 1.5–1.75× the font size)
inclusiveweb.co
 so text blocks are airy. For example, 16px text with 24px line-height. Paragraph spacing should exceed line spacing to create readable chunks
inclusiveweb.co
. This avoids fatigue and helps users track lines of text.

Together, these choices maximize readability and reduce eye strain during long study sessions

Design Tokens (Tailwind-friendly)

Backgrounds:

Light mode: --color-background: #F7FAFC (page background), --color-surface: #FFFFFF (cards, panels). These very light neutrals soften the display
blog.designcrowd.com
.

Dark mode: --color-background-dark: #0F172A, --color-surface-dark: #1E293B. Using slate grays (not black) for backgrounds reduces glare
altersquare.medium.com
.

Text Colors:

Primary: --color-text-primary: #1E293B (light), --color-text-primary-dark: #E2E8F0 (dark). 80–90% contrast is enough – dark gray on off-white is easier on eyes than black/white
inclusiveweb.co
.

Secondary: --color-text-secondary: #475569 (medium gray), --color-text-secondary-dark: #94A3B8 (lighter gray). Used for subheadings, captions.

Accent Colors:

--color-primary: #2563EB (soft blue) for primary buttons/links.

--color-secondary: #68D391 (gentle green) for secondary buttons or highlights.

--color-accent: #FBBF24 (warm gold) as a sparing highlight (e.g. icons).
In dark mode, use muted variants (e.g. --color-primary-dark: #60A5FA, --color-secondary-dark: #34D399). Ensure all accents meet contrast for text or icons on their backgrounds.

Font Families:

font-sans: e.g. ['Inter', 'sans-serif'] for body and UI text
inclusiveweb.co
.

font-serif: e.g. ['Merriweather', 'serif'] for headings/emphasis (conveys trust and formality)
designmodo.com
.

Buttons: Define three styles:

Primary: Bold color fill. Example Tailwind classes: px-4 py-2 bg-primary text-white rounded-lg font-semibold shadow-sm hover:opacity-90 transition (where bg-primary uses the --color-primary token). This is your main CTA style.

Secondary: Outline style. E.g. px-4 py-2 border border-primary text-primary bg-transparent rounded-lg hover:bg-primary hover:text-white transition. Provides a softer alternative for less-critical actions.

Ghost: Text-only. E.g. px-4 py-2 text-primary bg-transparent hover:text-secondary. No border or background; use only for very low-impact links.

Cards & Containers:

Background: bg-surface (white on light mode, slate-800 on dark).

Border: 1px border-border (light gray #E2E8F0 in light mode, #374151 in dark) for separation.

Elevation: Use subtle shadows to lift cards (e.g. Tailwind’s shadow-sm). A sample token: box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05).

Padding: Consistent whitespace inside cards (e.g. p-6 or 1.5rem). Rounded corners (e.g. rounded-lg).
This creates a clean, structured look on pages of text.

Shadows & Animations:

Shadows: Use very subtle drop-shadows (e.g. shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)) to separate layers without harshness. Heavy shadows or high blur are not needed – keep focus on content.

Transitions: For interactions (hover, focus), use gentle transitions (e.g. transition-colors duration-200 ease-in-out). Animations should be quick but smooth (start within ~0.1s
nngroup.com
) so they feel responsive, yet kept minimal so they don’t distract from studying.
