      "content": "[Octopuses are] mis ts in their own extended families . . . They belong to the Mollusca class Cephalopoda. But\nthey don’t look like their cousins at all. Other molluscs include sea snails, sea slugs, bivalves - most are shelled\ninvertebrates with a dorsal foot. Cephalopods are all arms, and can be as tiny as 1 centimetre and as large at\n30 feet. Some of them have brains the size of a walnut, which is large for an invertebrate. . . .\nIt makes sense for these molluscs to have added protection in the form of a higher cognition; they don’t have a\nshell covering them, and pretty much everything feeds on cephalopods, including humans. But how did\ncephalopods manage to secure their own invisibility cloak? Cephalopods re from multiple cylinders to achieve\nthis in varying degrees from species to species. There are four main catalysts - chromatophores, iridophores,\npapillae and leucophores. . . .\n[Chromatophores] are organs on their bodies that contain pigment sacs, which have red, yellow and brown\npigment granules. These sacs have a network of radial muscles, meaning muscles arranged in a circle radiating\noutwards. These are connected to the brain by a nerve. When the cephalopod wants to change colour, the brain\ncarries an electrical impulse through the nerve to the muscles that expand outwards, pulling open the sacs to\ndisplay the colours on the skin. Why these three colours? Because these are the colours the light re ects at the\ndepths they live in (the rest is absorbed before it reaches those depths). . . .\nWell, what about other colours? Cue the iridophores. Think of a second level of skin that has thin stacks of\ncells. These can re ect light back at different wavelengths. . . . It’s using the same properties that we’ve seen in\nhologram stickers, or rainbows on puddles of oil. You move your head and you see a different colour. The\nsticker isn’t doing anything but re ecting light - it’s your movement that’s changing the appearance of the\ncolour. This property of holograms, oil and other such surfaces is called “iridescence”. . . .\nPapillae are sections of the skin that can be deformed to make a texture bumpy. Even humans possess them\n(goosebumps) but cannot use them in the manner that cephalopods can. For instance, the use of these cells is\nhow an octopus can wrap itself over a rock and appear jagged or how a squid or cuttle sh can imitate the look\nof a coral reef by growing miniature towers on its skin. It actually matches the texture of the substrate it\nchooses.\nFinally, the leucophores: According to a paper, published in Nature, cuttle sh and octopuses possess an\nadditional type of re ector cell called a leucophore. They are cells that scatter full spectrum light so that they\nappear white in a similar way that a polar bear’s fur appears white. Leucophores will also re ect any ltered\nlight shown on them . . . If the water appears blue at a certain depth, the octopuses and cuttle sh can appear\nblue; if the water appears green, they appear green, and so on and so forth.",

      "content": "When we teach engineering problems now, we ask students to come to a single “best” solution de ned by\ntechnical ideals like low cost, speed to build, and ability to scale. This way of teaching primes students to\nbelieve that their decision-making is purely objective, as it is grounded in math and science. This is known as\ntechnical-social dualism, the idea that the technical and social dimensions of engineering problems are readily\nseparable and remain distinct throughout the problem-de nition and solution process.\nNontechnical parameters such as access to a technology, cultural relevancy or potential harms are deemed\npolitical and invalid in this way of learning. But those technical ideals are at their core social and political\nchoices determined by a dominant culture focused on economic growth for the most privileged segments of\nsociety. By choosing to downplay public welfare as a critical parameter for engineering design, we risk creating\na culture of disengagement from societal concerns amongst engineers that is antithetical to the ethical code of\nengineering.\nIn my eld of medical devices, ignoring social dimensions has real consequences. . . . Most FDA-approved\ndrugs are incorrectly dosed for people assigned female at birth, leading to unexpected adverse reactions. This\nis because they have been inadequately represented in clinical trials.\nBeyond physical failings, subjective beliefs treated as facts by those in decision-making roles can encode\nsocial inequities. For example, spirometers, routinely used devices that measure lung capacity, still have\ncorrection factors that automatically assume smaller lung capacity in Black and Asian individuals. These\nracially based adjustments are derived from research done by eugenicists who thought these racial differences\nwere biologically determined and who considered nonwhite people as inferior. These machines ignore the\nin uence of social and environmental factors on lung capacity.\nMany technologies for systemically marginalized people have not been built because they were not deemed\nimportant such as better early diagnostics and treatment for diseases like endometriosis, a disease that a icts\n10 percent of people with uteruses. And we hardly question whether devices are built sustainably, which has led\nto a crisis of medical waste and health care accounting for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\nSocial justice must be made core to the way engineers are trained. Some universities are working on this. . . .\nEngineers taught this way will be prepared to think critically about what problems we choose to solve, how we\ndo so responsibly and how we build teams that challenge our ways of thinking.\nIndividual engineering professors are also working to embed societal needs in their pedagogy. Darshan Karwat\nat the University of Arizona developed activist engineering to challenge engineers to acknowledge their full\nmoral and social responsibility through practical self-re ection. Khalid Kadir at the University of California,\nBerkeley, created the popular course Engineering, Environment, and Society that teaches engineers how to\nengage in place-based knowledge, an understanding of the people, context and history, to design better\ntechnical approaches in collaboration with communities. When we design and build with equity and justice in\nmind, we craft better solutions that respond to the complexities of entrenched systemic problems.",

      "content": "We begin with the emergence of the philosophy of the social sciences as an arena of thought and as a set of\nsocial institutions. The two characterisations overlap but are not congruent. Academic disciplines are social\ninstitutions. . . . My view is that institutions are all those social entities that organise action: they link acting\nindividuals into social structures. There are various kinds of institutions. Hegelians and Marxists emphasise\nuniversal institutions such as the family, rituals, governance, economy and the military. These are mostly\ninstitutions that just grew. Perhaps in some imaginary beginning of time they spontaneously appeared. In their\npresent incarnations, however, they are very much the product of conscious attempts to mould and plan them.\nWe have family law, established and disestablished churches, constitutions and laws, including those governing\nthe economy and the military. Institutions deriving from statute, like joint-stock companies are formal by\ncontrast with informal ones such as friendships. There are some institutions that come in both informal and\nformal variants, as well as in mixed ones. Consider the fact that the stock exchange and the black market are\nboth market institutions, one formal one not. Consider further that there are many features of the work of the\nstock exchange that rely on informal, noncodi able agreements, not least the language used for\ncommunication. To be precise, mixtures are the norm . . . From constitutions at the top to by-laws near the\nbottom we are always adding to, or tinkering with, earlier institutions, the grown and the designed are\nintertwined.\nIt is usual in social thought to treat culture and tradition as different from, although alongside, institutions. The\nview taken here is different. Culture and tradition are sub-sets of institutions analytically isolated for\nexplanatory or expository purposes. Some social scientists have taken all institutions, even purely local ones, to\nbe entities that satisfy basic human needs - under local conditions . . . Others differed and declared any\nstructure of reciprocal roles and norms an institution. Most of these differences are differences of emphasis\nrather than disagreements. Let us straddle all these versions and present institutions very generally . . . as\nstructures that serve to coordinate the actions of individuals. . . . Institutions themselves then have no aims or\npurpose other than those given to them by actors or used by actors to explain them . . .\nLanguage is the formative institution for social life and for science . . . Both formal and informal language is\ninvolved, naturally grown or designed. (Language is all of these to varying degrees.) Languages are paradigms\nof institutions or, from another perspective, nested sets of institutions. Syntax, semantics, lexicon and\nalphabet/character-set are all institutions within the larger institutional framework of a written language.\nNatural languages are typical examples of what Ferguson called ‘the result of human action, but not the\nexecution of any human design’[;] reformed natural languages and arti cial languages introduce design into\ntheir modi cations or re nements of natural language. Above all, languages are paradigms of institutional tools\nthat function to coordinate.",

      "content": "Humans today make music. Think beyond all the quali cations that might trail after this bald statement: that\nonly certain humans make music, that extensive training is involved, that many societies distinguish musical\nspecialists from nonmusicians, that in today’s societies most listen to music rather than making it, and so forth.\nThese quali cations, whatever their local merit, are moot in the face of the overarching truth that making music,\nconsidered from a cognitive and psychological vantage, is the province of all those who perceive and\nexperience what is made. We are, almost all of us, musicians — everyone who can entrain (not necessarily\ndance) to a beat, who can recognize a repeated tune (not necessarily sing it), who can distinguish one\ninstrument or one singing voice from another. I will often use an antique word, recently revived, to name this\nbroader musical experience. Humans are musicking creatures. . . .\nThe set of capacities that enables musicking is a principal marker of modern humanity. There is nothing\npolemical in this assertion except a certain insistence, which will gure often in what follows, that musicking be\nincluded in our thinking about fundamental human commonalities. Capacities involved in musicking are many\nand take shape in complicated ways, arising from innate dispositions . . . Most of these capacities overlap with\nnonmusical ones, though a few may be distinct and dedicated to musical perception and production. In the area\nof overlap, linguistic capacities seem to be particularly important, and humans are (in principle) language\nmakers in addition to music-makers — speaking creatures as well as musicking ones.\nHumans are symbol-makers too, a feature tightly bound up with language, not so tightly with music. The\nspecies Cassirer dubbed Homo symbolicus cannot help but tangle musicking in webs of symbolic thought and\nexpression, habitually making it a component of behavioral complexes that form such expression. But in\nfundamental features musicking is neither language-like nor symbol-like, and from these differences come\nmany clues to its ancient emergence.\nIf musicking is a primary, shared trait of modern humans, then to describe its emergence must be to detail the\ncoalescing of that modernity. This took place, archaeologists are clear, over a very long durée: at least 50,000\nyears or so, more likely something closer to 200,000, depending in part on what that coalescence is taken to\ncomprise. If we look back 20,000 years, a small portion of this long period, we reach the lives of humans whose\nmusical capacities were probably little different from our own. As we look farther back we reach horizons\nwhere this similarity can no longer hold — perhaps 40,000 years ago, perhaps 70,000, perhaps 100,000. But we\nnever cross a line before which all the cognitive capacities recruited in modern musicking abruptly disappear.\nUnless we embrace the incredible notion that music sprang forth in full-blown glory, its emergence will have to\nbe tracked in gradualist terms across a long period.\nThis is one general feature of a history of music’s emergence . . . The history was at once sociocultural and\nbiological . . . The capacities recruited in musicking are many, so describing its emergence involves following\nseveral or many separate strands.",

Customizations based on learning directly from potential users were critical to making this self-paced app suitable for both a literate and non-literate audience. ___(1)___ The user interface caters to a Hindi-speaking audience who have minimal to no experience with digital services and devices. ___(2)___ The content and functionality of the app are suitable for a wide audience. This includes youth preparing for an independent role in life or a student ready to create a strong foundation of financial management early in her life. ___(3)___ Household members desirous of improving their family’s financial strength to reach their aspirations can also benefit. We piloted Aage Badhein in early 2021 with over 400 women from rural areas. ___(4)___ The digital solution generated a large amount of interest in the communities.",

This information helps to clarify that the pilot study for the app involved a group of people who may be unfamiliar with digital devices and services, and it also helps to emphasize the potential impact that the app may have had on these users. Placing the sentence in blank 4 is logical because it provides relevant and specific information about the pilot study for the app, which is the topic being discussed in that part of the paragraph. By contrast, placing the sentence in any of the other blanks would be less logical because it would be introducing information that is not directly related to the main topic being discussed in those parts of the paragraph.
