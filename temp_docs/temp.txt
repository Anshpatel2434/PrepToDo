VERBAL ABILITY QUESTION GENERATION — GAP ANALYSIS & PROMPT UPGRADE GUIDE
(Based on CAT 2021–2024 Previous Year Papers)
================================================================================

PURPOSE
-------

This document defines how CAT Verbal Ability (VA) questions are actually designed,
and corrects common AI-generation failures such as:

- Over-simplification
- Grammar-based reasoning instead of logic-based reasoning
- Single-pattern repetition
- Predictable correct options

CAT VA questions are NOT language exercises.
They are logic, coherence, and discourse-structure tests.

This document provides:
1. Structural blueprints for each VA question type
2. Cognitive intent behind CAT design
3. Mandatory generation constraints
4. Anti-patterns to explicitly avoid


================================================================================
SECTION 1 — PARA SUMMARY (PS)
================================================================================

CORE OBSERVATION
----------------
Para Summary questions test the ability to:
- Identify the author’s *core claim*
- Suppress examples, tone flourishes, and metaphors
- Preserve **logical emphasis**, not wording

Summaries are NOT:
❌ Topic restatements  
❌ Shortened versions of one paragraph  
❌ Emotionally attractive paraphrases  


--------------------------------
1.1 TRUE STRUCTURE OF CAT PARA SUMMARY
--------------------------------

A CAT para summary typically:
- Removes anecdotes, metaphors, sarcasm, irony
- Retains:
  - Central tension
  - Authorial stance
  - Logical progression
- Is neutral in tone even if passage is emotive

Correct option characteristics:
- Covers the *entire passage*, not the opening
- Abstracts without generalising beyond scope
- Avoids keywords that appear verbatim in the passage

Wrong option design patterns:
- Too narrow (captures only one paragraph)
- Too broad (introduces a conclusion not reached)
- Emotionally exaggerated
- Rephrases examples instead of ideas


--------------------------------
1.2 PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD
--------------------------------

When generating Para Summary questions:

1. First extract:
   - Author’s central claim
   - Supporting logic (in one sentence)
2. Explicitly discard:
   - Illustrations
   - Rhetorical flourishes
3. Generate 4 summaries where:
   - Exactly ONE captures *logic + stance*
   - Others fail for DIFFERENT reasons
4. Ensure no option is a paraphrase of a single sentence


--------------------------------
1.3 ANTI-PATTERNS
--------------------------------

DO NOT:
- Let correct option be longest
- Use moral judgement words unless author does
- Repeat passage vocabulary excessively
- Make all wrong options partially correct


================================================================================
SECTION 2 — PARA COMPLETION (PC)
================================================================================

CORE OBSERVATION
----------------
Para Completion questions test:
- Logical flow
- Discourse continuity
- Cause–effect sequencing
- Referent tracking (this, that, such, they)

They are NOT grammar-fill exercises.

--------------------------------
2.1 TRUE STRUCTURE OF CAT PARA COMPLETION
--------------------------------

CAT para completion relies on:
- Conceptual continuity, not sentence adjacency
- Transitional logic (contrast, continuation, consequence)
- Cohesive devices:
  - Pronouns
  - Time markers
  - Logical pivots

Correct placement:
- Resolves a logical gap
- Explains or bridges surrounding ideas
- Makes following sentence inevitable

Wrong placements:
- Introduce concepts too early
- Repeat information already stated
- Break cause–effect order
- Create redundancy


--------------------------------
2.2 PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD
--------------------------------

When generating Para Completion questions:

1. First map paragraph as:
   - Idea A → Idea B → Idea C
2. Identify where:
   - Explanation is missing
   - Transition is required
3. Ensure the inserted sentence:
   - Is necessary, not decorative
4. Wrong positions must:
   - Feel tempting
   - Fail for *structural*, not grammatical reasons


--------------------------------
2.3 ANTI-PATTERNS
--------------------------------

DO NOT:
- Use grammar errors to eliminate options
- Make only one blank “sound right”
- Allow multiple plausible placements
- Ignore discourse markers


================================================================================
SECTION 3 — PARA JUMBLES (PJ)
================================================================================

CORE OBSERVATION
----------------
Para Jumbles test:
- Logical sequencing
- Idea dependency
- Argument scaffolding

They are NOT chronological puzzles.

--------------------------------
3.1 TRUE STRUCTURE OF CAT PARA JUMBLES
--------------------------------

CAT para jumbles usually have:
- One sentence that introduces context
- One or two that elaborate
- One that concludes or generalises

Key ordering cues:
- Pronouns require antecedents
- Examples require prior claims
- Conclusions cannot appear early

Correct sequence:
- Makes each sentence necessary for the next

Wrong sequences:
- Break referent clarity
- Place conclusions prematurely
- Separate example from claim


--------------------------------
3.2 PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD
--------------------------------

When generating Para Jumbles:

1. Identify:
   - Opening sentence (contextual, general)
   - Closing sentence (insight, implication)
2. Ensure:
   - Every sentence depends on at least one other
3. Create traps using:
   - Thematic similarity
   - Chronological illusion
4. Avoid surface connectors as sole cues


--------------------------------
3.3 ANTI-PATTERNS
--------------------------------

DO NOT:
- Make grammar the deciding factor
- Use explicit sequence markers (“first”, “finally”)
- Allow more than one valid order
- Create independent sentences


================================================================================
SECTION 4 — ODD ONE OUT (OOO)
================================================================================

CORE OBSERVATION
----------------
Odd One Out questions test:
- Thematic coherence
- Argument consistency
- Scope discipline

They are NOT about topic mismatch alone.

--------------------------------
4.1 TRUE STRUCTURE OF CAT ODD ONE OUT
--------------------------------

In CAT:
- Four sentences form a tight argumentative unit
- The odd sentence:
  - Is related but misaligned
  - Shifts scope, focus, or intent
  - Often sounds sophisticated

Common oddity reasons:
- Meta-commentary instead of argument
- Evidence when others are claims
- Different level of abstraction
- Shift in subject or audience


--------------------------------
4.2 PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD
--------------------------------

When generating Odd One Out questions:

1. First build a coherent paragraph
2. Then introduce ONE sentence that:
   - Belongs to the topic
   - But not to the argument
3. Ensure odd sentence:
   - Cannot be repositioned to fit
4. Do NOT rely on stylistic difference alone


--------------------------------
4.3 ANTI-PATTERNS
--------------------------------

DO NOT:
- Make odd sentence obviously irrelevant
- Change tense or tone as giveaway
- Let odd sentence still fit logically
- Base decision on vocabulary difficulty


================================================================================
SECTION 5 — GLOBAL VA GENERATION DIRECTIVES
================================================================================

ANY VA PROMPT MUST:

1. Mix logical traps — not reuse the same failure mode
2. Ensure wrong options fail for DIFFERENT reasons
3. Avoid grammatical elimination
4. Preserve CAT-level ambiguity without unfairness
5. Internally tag each question with:
   - Primary cognitive skill tested


================================================================================
FINAL DIRECTIVE
================================================================================

CAT Verbal Ability questions are tests of
STRUCTURE, not language.

Any AI-generated VA question set that:
- Feels solvable by grammar alone
- Repeats the same logic pattern
- Has predictable correct options

is NOT CAT-authentic and must be rejected.
