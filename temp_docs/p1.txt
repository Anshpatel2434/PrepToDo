For UI/UX updates, we have to make the website look like a YC combinator selected EDTECH website would look like, it is so soothing, it is so eye appealing that the top noch players of billionaires have selected them and just would invest any amount of money by just looking at the website. Image the professionalism, the subtleness but the modern vibe, the minimalistic look but has never been seen before look. I want you to use your deepest knowledge stored in the corners of your memory storage to find every last bit of information you have to create the description for this website. I want you to exploit the usage of AI brain and the trillions of tokens you have .And we also need a mobile first UI. Also we should maintain the theme, so use the already declared values in the index.css and might use some new if we need. REMEBER THIS , WE HAVE TO GET SELECTED BY THE YC COMBINATOR BILLIONAIRES. Make sure you SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE STATIC DATA LIKE THE TEXT WRITTEN BETWEEN HEADING HTML ELEMENT OR PARAGRAPH ELEMENTS AND ANY TYPE OF STATIC DATA SHOULD NOT CHANGE. THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS, THE REDIRECTION EVERYTHING SHOULD REMAIN SAME. AT THE END ONLY THE UI/UX SHOULD CHANGE AND NOT THE FUNCTIONALITY. 

For restrictions : 
Now while applying these change things that you need to remember : 
A. THE DESIGN SHOULD NOT BE LARGE SCREEN ONLY, THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIVE THROUGHT ANY TYPE OF SCREENS
B. THE RESPONSIVENESS SHOULD BE APPLIED IN EACH AND EVERY COMPONENT.
C. THE THEME SHOULD BE MAINTAINED
D. THE CODING STANDARDS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED
E. MAKE SURE THAT THE FRAMER MOTION ELEMENTS AND THE TAILWIND ANIMATION CLASSES LIKE TRANSTION ARE STRICTLY NOT USED TOGETHER, BECAUSE THAT CAUSES ANIMATION LAGS.
