Folder : "apps\web\src\pages\home"
Now this is the folder that we have to show okay, along with the images that we are using but just imagine a crazy YC combinator selected EDTECH website would look like, it is so soothing, it is so eye appealing that the top noch players of billionaires have selected them and just would invest any amount of money by just looking at the website. Image the professionalism, the subtleness but the modern vibe, the minimalistic look but has never been seen before look. I want you to use your deepest knowledge stored in the corners of your memory storage to find every last bit of information you have to create the description for this website. I want you to exploit the usage of AI brain and the trillions of tokens you have .And we also need a mobile first UI. Also I love the exploding effects that we have currently so we as well keep that with us. Make sure to add in the instructions that we should keep all the images that are present in the component. Also we should maintain the theme, so use the already declared values in the index.css and might use some new if we need. REMEBER THIS , WE HAVE TO GET SELECTED BY THE YC COMBINATOR BILLIONAIRES. Make sure you SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE STATIC DATA LIKE THE TEXT WRITTEN BETWEEN HEADING HTML ELEMENT OR PARAGRAPH ELEMENTS AND ANY TYPE OF STATIC DATA SHOULD NOT CHANGE. THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS, THE REDIRECTION EVERYTHING SHOULD REMAIN SAME. AT THE END ONLY THE UI/UX SHOULD CHANGE AND NOT THE FUNCTIONALITY. AND PLEASE KEEP THE EXPLOADING EFFECT, THE EFFECT IS AS IF THE DASHBOARD ELEMENTS HAS POP OUT OF IT AND THE 4 WIDGETS ARE AVAILABLE IN 3D SPACE LIKE EFFECT.
