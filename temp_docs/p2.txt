Now as you have wonderfully identified the errors and completely replicated the previous version of analytics folder. We have to do something similar for the "services\workers\daily-content" folder. Now let me help you a little, if you look carefully at the "services\workers\daily-content\runDailyContent.ts" and the "services\workers\daily-content\functions" you will find that the file has been divided into 8 different function because we had the limitation of the edge function, but now as we move towards our own backend architecture and can run a long session, we will move towards the single file only. Now your job would be to add this whole worker into our backend architecture just like we added the analytics worker and plus one more task would be to identify the "apps\web\src\pages\daily\redux_usecase" and change the backend calls to our own backend architecture and create respective routes in our own backend too. You can see this "apps\web\src\pages\auth\redux_usecases" folder and "services\backend\src\features\auth" for reference and understand the coding standards and everything of how to built .
